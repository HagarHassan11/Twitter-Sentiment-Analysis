# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysisüìäüê¶

## Overview
Welcome to the Twitter Sentiment Analysis project! This project focuses on leveraging deep learning techniques, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), to analyze and categorize the sentiment of tweets. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and classification algorithms, I've built a system that can classify tweets into positive, negative, or neutral categories.

## Objectives
1. **Sentiment Classification**: The main goal is to accurately classify the sentiment expressed in a tweet, providing insights into the emotional tone of the text.

2. **Deep Learning Model**: I've implemented a deep learning model, specifically CNN, trained on a labeled dataset to achieve sentiment classification. The model has learned to recognize patterns and features associated with different sentiments.

## CNN Model
The heart of this project lies in the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for sentiment analysis. CNNs are powerful deep learning models known for their effectiveness in image recognition tasks. In this project, they are adapted to capture spatial patterns and relationships within the textual data.
